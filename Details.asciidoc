== Logging

Even if this is just a small sample application, the usage of
`System.out.println` is not advised, because this introduces
a static binding in the code, which can hardly be replaced in
the future.

Because a clean software design is one of the requirements, a tiny
logging framework was designed, which has a interface close to slf4j
or log4j. So it will be possible to migrate to a real logging
framework in the future. Of course, the formatting of the log lines
has to be adjusted if a real logging framework is used.


== Code Coverage

JaCoCo was added to the build chain (Maven phase `test`) in order
to get code coverage support for the unit tests.


== Package Structure

As the two _domains_ "weather" and "football" are very small, the package
structure was built by functionality and not by domain.
